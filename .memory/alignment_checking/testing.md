## Status

**Go-specific notes:**
- Test Environment: `testsuite.WorkflowTestSuite` + `testsuite.TestWorkflowEnvironment` from `go.temporal.io/sdk/testsuite`
- Uses testify library (`suite.Suite`, `assert`, `mock`)
- Activity Mocking: `env.OnActivity(ActivityFunc, mock.Anything, ...).Return(result, nil)` — can use function replacement
- Testing Signals: `env.RegisterDelayedCallback` to send signals; `env.SignalWorkflow`
- Testing Queries: `env.QueryWorkflow("queryName")` returns `converter.EncodedValue`
- Testing Failure: `env.GetWorkflowError()` + `errors.As(err, &applicationErr)`
- Replay Testing: `worker.ReplayWorkflowHistory` with JSON history
- Activity Testing: `testsuite.TestActivityEnvironment` for isolated activity tests
- Time Skipping: built into TestWorkflowEnvironment (timers fire immediately)

**Intentionally missing (`—`):**
- Core column: no core testing.md exists (implementation-specific)
- Time Skipping: mentioned inline (built into test environment)

**Order alignment:** ✅ Aligned — Go sections match Python/TypeScript order

**Style alignment:** ✅ Complete (Python, TypeScript)
