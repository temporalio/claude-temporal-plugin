## Status

**Go-specific notes:**
- Schedules: `client.ScheduleClient` — same concept as Python/TS
- Async Activity Completion: `activity.GetInfo(ctx).TaskToken` + `client.CompleteActivity` / `client.CompleteActivityByID`
- Worker Tuning: `worker.Options` — `MaxConcurrentActivityExecutionSize`, `MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutionSize`, `MaxConcurrentActivityTaskPollers`
- Sessions: Go-specific feature — `workflow.CreateSession(ctx, options)` pins activities to a specific worker. Useful for file processing where activities need local state.
**Intentionally missing (`—`):**
- Core column: advanced features are implementation-specific
- Sandbox Customization: Python-specific; Go has no sandbox
- Gevent Compatibility Warning: Python-specific
- Workflow Init Decorator: Python-specific
- Workflow Failure Exception Types: Python-specific
- Sinks: TS-specific feature
- Sessions: Go-specific (not in Python/TS)
- Interceptors: Decided not to include for any language (all SDKs have them, but too advanced for current scope)

**Order alignment:** N/A — Files have different structures by design

**Style alignment:** ✅ Complete (Python, TypeScript)
